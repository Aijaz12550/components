## Process create a new component

1) Create a folder with the name of the component, example `list` or `chart-bar`
2) Create a file named `component.json` inside the folder containing:
  ```JSON
  {
    "name":"chart-bar",
    "author": "fabiorogeriosj",
    "dependencies": [
      "base"
    ]
  }
  ```
3) Test and document your component in an HTML file inside your component's folder
4) Open a Pull Request against the `master` branch
5) Wait for review and discussion. Do poke us if a few days elapse to remind us.
6) Your code will be merged if accepted!
